# Kreo Beach Cleaner - Robot Beach Cleaner 🌊

![Cover picture](/Docs/Cover_picture.png)

## 🌟 Project background

This project was carried out during an internship in Mauritius. The main objective was to design an autonomous robot capable of cleaning beaches while storing the collected waste. This project is part of an effort to preserve the environment and combat marine pollution.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Beach cleaning** : Waste detection and collection.
- **Autonomy** : Navigation without human intervention.
- **Efficient storage**: Integration of a compartment for transporting collected waste.

## ⚙️ Main features

1. **Mechanical structure** :
   - Lightweight, robust chassis suitable for sandy terrain.
   - Collection system with ramp and sieve cylinder.
   - The 3D conception of the robot can be find [here](https://a360.co/3raTjkV).

2. **Electronic system** :
   - Arduino boards for sensor and motor control.
   - Sensors for obstacle detection and waste identification (ultrasound, cameras).

3. **Software and AI**:
   - Algorithms for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.
   - Recognition system to distinguish waste from sand.
